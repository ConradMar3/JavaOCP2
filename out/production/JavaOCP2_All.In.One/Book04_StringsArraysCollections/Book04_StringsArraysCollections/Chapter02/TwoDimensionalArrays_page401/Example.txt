The elements of an array can be any type of object you want, including another
array. In the latter case, you have a two-dimensional array, sometimes called an
array of arrays.

Two-dimensional arrays are often used to track data in column-and-row format,
much the way that a spreadsheet works.

Create an array with 20 elements, like this:

> double[] sales = new sales[20];
