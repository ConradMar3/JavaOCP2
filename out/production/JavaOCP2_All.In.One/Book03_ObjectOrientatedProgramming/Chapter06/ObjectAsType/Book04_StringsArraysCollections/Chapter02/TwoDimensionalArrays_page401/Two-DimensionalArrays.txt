To declare a two-dimensional array for this sales data, you simply list two sets of
empty brackets, like this:

> double sales[][];

Here sales is a two-dimensional array of type double. To put it another way,
sales is an array of double arrays.

To create the array, you use the new keyword and provide lengths for each set of
brackets, as in this example:

> sales = new double[5][4];

1. Here the first dimension specifies that the sales array has five elements. This
   array represents the rows in the table.
2. The second dimension specifies that each
   of those elements has an array of type double with four elements. This array rep-
   resents the columns in the table.

Note that as with a one-dimensional array, you can declare and create a two-
dimensional array in one statement, like this:

> double[][] sales = new double[5][4];

Here the sales array is declared and created all in one statement.
