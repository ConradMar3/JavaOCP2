2. boolean equals(Object obj) -> Indicates whether this object is equal to the obj object.
3. protected void finalize() -> Is called by the garbage collector when the object is destroyed.
4. Class getClass() -> Returns a Class object that represents this object’s runtime class.
5. int hashCode() -> Returns this object’s hash code.
6. void notify() -> Is used with threaded applications to wake up a thread that’s waiting on this object.
7. void notifyAll() -> Is used with threaded applications to wake up all threads that are waiting on this object.
8. String toString() -> Returns a String representation of this object.
9. void wait() -> Causes this object’s thread to wait until another thread calls notify or notify All.
10. void wait(Long timeout) -> Is a variation of the basic wait method.
11. void wait(Long timeout,int nanos) -> Is yet another variation of the wait method.

/*
Note: Almost half of these methods (notify, notifyAll, and the three wait methods) are related to threading.
      You find complete information about those five methods in Book 5, Chapter 1.
