/*
Object is the mother of all classes. In Java, every class ultimately inherits the Object
class. This class provides a set of methods that is available to every Java object.
*/

/*
Any class that doesn't have an extends clause implicitly inherits Object.
Thus, you never have to code a class like this:

"public class Product extends Object..."

If a subclass has an extends clause that specifies a superclass other than Object,
the class still inherits Object. That’s because the inheritance hierarchy eventually gets to a superclass that doesn’t
have an extends clause, and that superclass inherits Object and passes it down to all its subclasses.

Suppose you have these classes:

> public class Manager extends SalariedEmployee...
> public class SalariedEmployee extends Employee...
> public class Employee extends Person...
> public class Person...

Here the Manager class inherits the Object class indirectly because it inherits SalariedEmployee,
which inherits Employee, which inherits Person, which inherits Object.
In Java, creating a class that doesn't inherit Object is not possible.
