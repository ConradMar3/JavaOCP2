/*
To use the classes in an archive, you must add the jar file to your ClassPath environment variable.
I describe the procedure for modifying the ClassPath variable
in Windows XP earlier in this chapter, in the section “Creating your own packages.”
So I won’t repeat the details here.

To add an archive to the ClassPath variable, just add the complete path to the
archive, making sure to separate it from any other paths already in the ClassPath
with a semicolon. Here’s an example:

> .;c:\javaclasses\utils.jar;c:\javaclasses

Here I added the path c:\javaclasses\utils.jar to my ClassPath variable.
Starting with Java 1.6, you can add all the jar files from a particular directory to
the ClassPath in one fell swoop. For example, imagine that your c:\javaclasses
directory contains two jar files — utils.jar and extras.jar. To add both jar
files to the ClassPath, use a forward slash (/) followed by an asterisk:

> .;c:\javaclasses/*
 */
