/*
1. An import statement can import all the classes in a package by using an asterisk
   wildcard. Here all the classes in the java.util package are imported:

  > import java.util.*;

2. Alternatively, you can import classes one at a time. Here just the ArrayList class
   is imported:

   > import java.util.ArrayList;

3. Note: You don’t have to use an import statement to use a class from a package.
   But if you don’t use an import statement, you must fully qualify any references to
   the class. For example, you can use the ArrayList class without importing java.
   util:

   > java.util.ArrayList = new java.util.ArrayList();

4. You never have to explicitly import two packages:

  > java.lang:
  (This package contains classes that are so commonly used that the
   Java compiler makes them available to every program.)

5. The default package:

   (This package contains classes that aren’t specifically
    put in some other package.)
