Method -> Description

append(primitiveType) -> Appends the string representation of the primitive type to the end of
                         the string.
append(Object) ->        Calls the object’s toString method and appends the result to the end
                         of the string.
append(CharSequence) ->  Appends the string to the end of the StringBuilder’s string value. The
                         parameter can be a String, StringBuilder, or StringBuffer.
char charAt(int) ->      Returns the character at the specified position in the string.
delete(int, int) ->      Deletes characters starting with the first int and ending with the
                         character before the second int.
deleteCharAt(int) ->     Deletes the character at the specified position.
ensureCapacity(int) ->   Ensures that the capacity of String-Builder is at least equal to the
                         int value; increases the capacity if necessary.
int capacity() ->        Returns the capacity of this StringBuilder.
int indexOf(String) ->   Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified string. If the
                         string doesn't appear, returns -1.
int indexOf(String,int)->Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified string, starting
                         the search at the specified index position. If the string doesn't appear,
                         returns -1.
insert(int,primitiveType)->Inserts the string representation of the primitive type at the point
                           specified by the int argument.
insert(int, Object) ->   Calls the toString method of the Object parameter and then inserts
                         the resulting string at the point specified by the int argument.
insert(int, CharSequence)->Inserts the string at the point specified by the int argument. The second
                           parameter can be a String, StringBuilder, or StringBuffer.
int lastIndexOf(String)->Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified string. If the
                         string doesn't appear, returns -1.
int lastIndexOf(String, int)->Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified string, starting
                              the search at the specified index position. If the string doesn't appear,
                              returns -1.
int length() ->         Returns the length of this string.
replace(int, int, String)->Replaces the substring indicated by the first two parameters with the
                           string provided by the third parameter.
reverse() Reverses the order of characters.
setCharAt(int, char) Sets the character at the specified position to the specified character.
setLength(int) Sets the length of the string. If that length is less than the current
length, the string is truncated; if it’s greater than the current length, new
characters — hexadecimal zeros — are added.
String substring(int) Extracts a substring, beginning at the position indicated by the int
parameter and continuing to the end of the string.
String
substring(int, int)
Extracts a substring, beginning at the position indicated by the first
parameter and ending at the position one character before the value of
the second parameter.
String toString() Returns the current value as a String.
String trimToSize() Reduces the capacity of the StringBuffer to match the size of
the string.
