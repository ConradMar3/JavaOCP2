! - Not Unary Returns true if the operand to the right evaluates to false.
Returns false if the operand to the right is true.

& - And Binary Returns true if both of the operands evaluate to true. Both
operands are evaluated before the And operator is applied.

| - Or Binary Returns true if at least one of the operands evaluates to
true. Both operands are evaluated before the Or operator
is applied.

^ - Xor Binary Returns true if one — and only one — of the operands
evaluates to true. Returns false if both operands evaluate
to true or if both operands evaluate to false.

&& - Conditional And Binary Same as &, but if the operand on the left returns false,
returns false without evaluating the operand on the right.

|| - Conditional Or Binary Same as |, but if the operand on the left returns true,
returns true without evaluating the operand on the right.
